    "**In this notebook we will provide functions that allow testing your answers.** Testing implies checking whether your code meets a set of requirements. If your code fails atleast one requirement, you will receive an error specifying where the test has failed. If the test passes, you will receive the message `All tests passed! Good job!`.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note that in the next assignments, these test functions will not be provided.__ \n",
    "\n",
    "The autograding system has some implications on how you should complete these assignments:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ➜ save results to variables with the **required identifier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we ask you to create a variable `my_name` with a string of your name, you should do it the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_name = \"John Doe\" # ✅ GOOD\n",
    "\n",
    "My_name = \"John Doe\" # ❌ WRONG (wrong variable name!)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"John Doe\" # ❌ WRONG (not saving to a variable!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very important, because we will look for the variable `my_name` when grading your work. Note that **Python is case sensitive language**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ➜ ensure code **runs end-to-end without errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "After you are done with your assignment you are encouraged to validate whether it runs end to end by restarting Jupyter's kernel and running the whole code (eg. press `Kernel` -> `Restart Kernell and Run All Cells`). \n",
    "\n",
    "If your code fails to run end to end it is possible that the autograder won't be able to evaluate some of your answers. In such cases we have to manually validate your assignment, which implies a slower grading process.\n"
